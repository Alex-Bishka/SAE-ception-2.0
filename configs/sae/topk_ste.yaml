# TopK SAE with Straight-Through Estimator
# Uses top-k selection with better gradient flow for all features

sae_type: topk_ste

# SAE architecture
expansion_factor: 8  # hidden_dim = expansion_factor * input_dim
k: 50               # Number of active features per input (controls sparsity)

# Training
learning_rate: 1e-4
batch_size: 64
epochs: 5
log_interval: 100

# Optimization
optimizer: adam
weight_decay: 0.0

# Note: STE variant allows gradients to flow to non-selected features
# which can improve training dynamics and feature utilization
